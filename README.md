# JPProject 
What is the project?
They could be asked to create a production plant for any type of product ranging from a simple packaging system to a variety of electronic devices. Recently they have been asked to create a production line for multimedia devices which include music and movie players.  They wish to employee you to design a template in Java for creating and recording all future production line items.  For this particular production facility you will only implement a concrete class for music and movie players. This is a project that is put out by Oracle.
