# JPProject 
What is the project?
They could be asked to create a production plant for any type of product ranging from a simple packaging system to a variety of electronic devices. Recently they have been asked to create a production line for multimedia devices which include music and movie players.  They wish to employee you to design a template in Java for creating and recording all future production line items.  For this particular production facility you will only implement a concrete class for music and movie players. This is a project that is put out by Oracle.

# Getting Started
You will need to have Intellij IDEA installed on your computer to run this code. You can get the community version and it will still work and you will need JDK 8,10, or 11.
